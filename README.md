# Tower

> Version 1.8 :memo:  
> A little mobile game with RPG mechanics made with native JS.

## How to use it ?

You can try the app : https://nicolas-deleforge.fr/apps/tower/  
Or download it : https://github.com/n-deleforge/game-tower/archive/main.zip  
Or clone the git : ```git clone https://github.com/n-deleforge/game-tower.git```

## Note for self-host

If you download or clone the project to host it yourself, then you'll need [**Little JS**](https://github.com/n-deleforge/littleJS) at the line 128 of `index.html`. Also, I do not upload the web manifest and the service worker on Github but they are still present at the line 5 and 409 of `core.js`.

# Ressources

The majority of the resources (images and sounds) are from the basic library of RPG Maker MV that I own. The icons of the top bar are from a free pack on (https://kyrise.itch.io/kyrises-free-16x16-rpg-icon-pack) Itchio.
