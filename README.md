## Note for self-host

If you download or clone the project to host it yourself, then you'll need [**Little JS**](https://github.com/n-deleforge/littleJS) at the line 142 of `index.html`.

## Ressources

The majority of the resources (images and sounds) are from the basic library of RPG Maker MV that I own. The icons of the top bar are from a free pack on (https://kyrise.itch.io/kyrises-free-16x16-rpg-icon-pack) Itchio.
